Streamlit Authentication Setup
This project demonstrates how to set up simple username and password authentication in Streamlit using the streamlit-authenticator library. Below are the steps to get the project running.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.x
pip (Python package manager)
Installation Steps
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/kubenine-authentication.git
cd kubenine-authentication
Install Required Libraries

Install all necessary libraries by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Credentials

Create a file named credentials.yaml to store the user credentials and cookie settings.

Example credentials.yaml file:

yaml
Copy code
credentials:
  usernames:
    admin:
      name: admin
      email: admin@example.com
      password: <hashed_password_here>  # Replace with your bcrypt-hashed password

cookie:
  expiry_days: 30
  key: superstrongkey
  name: demo_cookie
Hash the Password

Use the hash.py script to hash your password securely:

bash
Copy code
python hash.py
Replace the <hashed_password_here> in your credentials.yaml file with the generated hash.

Run the Application

After setting up the credentials, you can start the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run main.py
This will open the app in your default browser. Log in using the credentials you set in credentials.yaml.
