# Streamlit Authentication Setup

This guide demonstrates how to implement basic username and password authentication in **Streamlit** using the **streamlit-authenticator** library. Follow the instructions below to successfully set up and run the authentication system.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** (Python's package manager)

---

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/kubenine-authentication.git
cd kubenine-authentication
2. Install Required Libraries
Install all necessary dependencies by running the command below:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Up Credentials
Create a file named credentials.yaml to store user credentials and session-related configurations, such as usernames, hashed passwords, and cookie settings.

4. Hash the Password
To securely hash your password, use the provided hash.py script:

Run the script by executing the following command:

bash
Copy code
python hash.py
After running the script, it will generate a hashed version of your password. Copy this hashed password.

Open the credentials.yaml file and replace the placeholder <hashed_password_here> with the hashed password generated in the previous step.

5. Create the Main Application File
File: main.py
This file is responsible for handling the user authentication process via the streamlit-authenticator library. Ensure that credentials.yaml is correctly referenced in this file to enable proper authentication.

6. Run the Application
To launch the Streamlit application, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run main.py
This will start the application and open it in your default web browser. You can log in using the credentials stored in the credentials.yaml file.

Now your Streamlit app is up and running with authentication functionality. Enjoy!
